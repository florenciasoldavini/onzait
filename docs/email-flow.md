# Product Email Flow

Purpose: test and document the first non-auth email path
Source of truth for: product email boundaries, Edge Function secrets, and the current welcome-email example
Update when: product email providers, function names, secrets, or invocation rules change

## Current Example

The first product email example is `welcome-to-onzait`.

Flow:

1. App code calls `sendWelcomeToOnzaitEmail` from `services/email.service.ts`.
2. The service calls `invokeWelcomeToOnzaitEmail` from `repositories/email.repository.ts`.
3. The repository invokes the Supabase Edge Function `welcome-to-onzait`.
4. The Edge Function validates the signed-in user with Supabase Auth.
5. The Edge Function uses its service-role Supabase client to reserve `public.users.welcome_email_sent_at` only when the marker is still empty.
6. Only the request that successfully reserves the marker renders the Onzait-styled React Email template to HTML and sends it through Resend.

The client does not send a recipient email address. The function chooses the recipient from the authenticated user's `public.users` row.
The client also does not write the sent marker; that belongs to the Edge Function so repeated app launches cannot repeatedly send the same product email.

## Failure Contract

The function returns application-owned error codes and product wording. Public
responses must never include environment-variable names, provider names, raw
provider bodies, database details, or exception messages.

Configuration, database, and delivery diagnostics stay in trusted Edge Function
logs. If rendering or delivery fails after the function reserves
`welcome_email_sent_at`, it conditionally clears that exact reservation so a
later app session can retry without overwriting a newer successful delivery.

## Trigger Rule

The welcome email should trigger after the user's email is verified and the app has created or loaded their `public.users` profile. In practice, `contexts/auth.tsx` calls the email service when a signed-in user is hydrated and `welcome_email_sent_at` is empty.

The email is intentionally not sent at raw signup time because email/password users may still be unverified. The marker keeps the email once-per-user across future logins, page refreshes, and app launches.

## Function Files

- `supabase/functions/welcome-to-onzait/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/welcome-to-onzait/errors.ts`
- `supabase/functions/_shared/email/welcome-to-onzait.tsx`
- `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts`

## Template Development

React Email is installed as a dev dependency and templates live in:

```txt
supabase/functions/_shared/email
```

Preview templates locally with:

```sh
npm run email:dev
```

## Required Secrets

For local function testing:

```sh
supabase functions serve welcome-to-onzait --env-file .env.local
```

For production, add these in Supabase Edge Function secrets:

```txt
RESEND_API_KEY
EMAIL_FROM
EMAIL_REPLY_TO
SITE_URL
```

`RESEND_API_KEY` is required. Supabase provides `SUPABASE_URL` and server-side API key variables to deployed Edge Functions. The shared auth helper accepts named/current publishable-key variables and the legacy `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` fallback; privileged email state updates continue to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. The other values have development fallbacks, but should be set before production.

## Deployment Checklist

Apply the database marker migration:

```sh
npx supabase db push
```

Add or update the Edge Function secrets in the Supabase dashboard or with the Supabase CLI:

```sh
npx supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY="..."
npx supabase secrets set EMAIL_FROM="Onzait <onboarding@resend.dev>"
npx supabase secrets set SITE_URL="https://onzait.vercel.app"
```

Then deploy the function:

```sh
npx supabase functions deploy welcome-to-onzait --use-api
```

After deployment, test with a verified user whose `public.users.welcome_email_sent_at` value is empty.

## Sender Defaults

Until a sending domain is verified, the function falls back to:

```txt
Onzait <onboarding@resend.dev>
```

After a domain is verified, use a sender like:

```txt
Onzait <no-reply@auth.onzait.com>
```

The pending domain, DNS, and branded sender checklist lives in [docs/pending-launch-setup.md](/Users/florenciasoldavini/Documents/Projects/OnSite/on-site/docs/pending-launch-setup.md:1).

## Test Invocation

From app code, call:

```ts
await sendWelcomeToOnzaitEmail({ name: "Flor" });
```

The user must be signed in. Supabase will include the current session JWT when invoking the Edge Function.
