# Source Architecture

Purpose: define where product code belongs and which dependency directions are allowed
Source of truth for: feature ownership, shared code, infrastructure boundaries, and new-feature scaffolding
Update when: a new source layer is introduced or an ownership boundary changes

Feature directories may omit layers they do not need. Do not create empty folders merely to complete the template. Feature roots contain responsibility directories only; implementation modules should not be left loose at the feature root.

File-backed product domains follow the same dependency rule. For example, `features/documents` owns document screens, hooks, workflows, row/Storage repositories, validation, types, and platform-specific open/download adapters; its routes only normalize project IDs and delegate to those screens.

## Dependency Direction

```text
app route
  -> feature screen or component
    -> feature hook or service
      -> feature repository
        -> infrastructure client, Storage, or Edge Function
```

- Routes should contain route declarations, parameter normalization, guards, and delegation only.
- Screens and components must not import repositories or infrastructure directly.
- Hooks own React Query/cache behavior and call services.
- Services own product workflows and may compose repositories.
- Repositories own raw SDK, database, Storage, and external transport calls.
- Providers own React context state and call hooks or services rather than repositories or infrastructure.
- Shared code must not import a product feature.
- Cross-feature code must use the owning feature's hook, service, provider, or exported type; repository internals are not a cross-feature API.

ESLint enforces the most important import boundaries in `eslint.config.js`.

## Route Declarations

Every non-layout file under `app/` uses the same explicit wrapper shape:

```tsx
import ClientDetailScreen from "@/features/clients/screens/client-detail-screen";
import { parseRequiredUuidRouteParam } from "@/shared/utils/route-params";
import { useLocalSearchParams } from "expo-router";

export default function ClientDetailRoute() {
  const params = useLocalSearchParams<{
    clientId: string | string[];
  }>();
  const clientId = parseRequiredUuidRouteParam(params.clientId);

  return <ClientDetailScreen clientId={clientId ?? undefined} />;
}
```

- Name the default route component `<Purpose>Route`. Do not directly export a screen or use a default re-export.
- `app/` owns Expo Router inputs. Read and normalize path parameters, query parameters, and URL fragments in the route, then pass ordinary typed props to the feature screen.
- Use `firstRouteParam` for a repeated scalar query parameter, `parseRequiredUuidRouteParam` for a required UUID path parameter, and `parseOptionalUuidRouteParam` for an optional UUID query parameter.
- A missing or malformed required identifier is passed to the screen as `undefined`; the screen's `RouteStateBoundary` then renders finite invalid-route feedback without starting a record query.
- Feature screens may use navigation actions such as `useRouter`, but must not use `useLocalSearchParams` or parse URL fragments.
- Route files contain declarations, parameter normalization, route-specific guards, and screen delegation only. Domain behavior and product UI stay in the feature.
- Deliberate `React.lazy` bundle boundaries are allowed, but the route still follows the same explicit wrapper and parameter ownership rules.
- Layout files use named `<Purpose>Layout` components. The root layout's monitoring wrapper is the only default-export expression exception.

## Screen Composition

A screen coordinates the lifecycle of an entire page. It owns page-level queries, permissions, navigation outcomes, and the full-page `RouteStateBoundary`, then delegates the successfully loaded presentation to feature components.

For a substantial page, colocate its visual sections under a component family:

```text
features/projects/
  screens/
    project-detail-screen.tsx
  components/
    project-detail/
      project-detail-content.tsx
      project-detail-header.tsx
      project-client-card.tsx
      project-progress-card.tsx
      project-action-grid.tsx
      project-detail-skeleton.tsx
      project-detail.styles.ts
```

- Keep invalid, loading, load-error, forbidden, not-found, and successful-content precedence visible in the screen.
- Pass guaranteed successful data to the content component instead of repeating nullable checks throughout the page.
- Extract a recognizable page section when it has its own interaction state, query or mutation, responsive layout, substantial styles, or independently testable behavior.
- Screen modules contain one screen component. Secondary React components, pure helper functions, and `StyleSheet.create` definitions belong in the screen's colocated component family or feature utilities.
- Keep small one-off markup in the screen or its nearest section; do not create components solely to reduce line count.
- Section components may consume feature hooks when the state belongs to that section. Services still own product workflows, and query hooks still own server/cache behavior.
- Put screen-family constants and styles beside that component family when they are not reused by the broader feature.
- Do not replace a large screen with one opaque `use<ScreenName>Controller` hook. The page lifecycle and data dependencies should remain directly readable.
- Treat roughly 100–250 lines as a review signal for a screen, not a hard limit. A complex form or virtualized collection coordinator may remain longer when it still has one responsibility and extraction would create an opaque prop interface.

## Model Ownership

Each domain contract belongs to the feature that will implement it. Planned contracts are preserved in their future owner, such as `features/workers/types/` or `features/materials/types/`, instead of a global model directory.

The planned daily-report model and its embedded weather observation belong to `features/daily-reports/`. The editable attendance register belongs to `features/attendance/`, while report attendance snapshots belong to `features/daily-reports/` (see [attendance.md](./attendance.md)). Their contracts and future persistence rules are defined in [daily-reports.md](./daily-reports.md) and [daily-report-weather.md](./daily-report-weather.md).

An active entity must have one canonical TypeScript contract. Zod schemas validate that contract from the same feature; emitted `.js`, `.d.ts`, and source-map copies must not be committed beside TypeScript source. TypeScript runs with `noEmit` for the Expo application.

## Adding A Feature

1. Create `features/<feature>/` with only the layers required by the first implemented behavior.
2. Place route-level UI under `features/<feature>/screens/` and add a thin route under `app/`.
3. Keep platform variants beside the shared module using Expo suffixes such as `.web.tsx`, `.ios.tsx`, or `.android.tsx`.
4. Put reusable code in `shared/` only when it is genuinely product-agnostic or already needed by more than one feature.
5. Add unit, flow, and database/RLS tests appropriate to the feature.

## Adaptive Presentation

Onzait shares routes, feature state, hooks, services, and repositories across supported devices while allowing layout-specific navigation and feature presentations. Reusable layout classification and application-shell primitives belong under `shared/`; feature-specific compact, medium, or expanded presentations belong to the owning feature.

Use platform-specific files for genuine platform implementation differences, not as a substitute for width-driven adaptation. The complete layout contract, navigation model, presentation rules, and verification matrix live in [adaptive-layout-strategy.md](./adaptive-layout-strategy.md).

## Naming

- Directories and non-component modules use kebab-case.
- React components use named PascalCase exports; Expo Router files default-export an explicit named route or layout component.
- Services use `.service.ts`, repositories use `.repository.ts`, and runtime schemas use `.schema.ts` or `.schemas.ts`.
- Avoid generic catch-all directories such as `lib/` and global layer directories such as `screens/`, `services/`, or `types/models/`.
