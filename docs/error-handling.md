# Error-handling baseline

Purpose: define how Onzait classifies, records, and presents failures
Source of truth for: user-visible error copy, provider-error translation, retry states, and permission-denial behavior
Update when: error types, monitoring boundaries, provider integrations, or critical async flows change

## Product rule

Every error shown to a user must be clear, actionable, and written in product language. Never render a raw provider, database, HTTP, SDK, or exception message in the interface.

Good messages explain what the user was trying to do and the safest next action:

- `We couldn't load this project. Check your connection and try again.`
- `Photo access is disabled. Enable it in your device settings, then try again.`
- `Your session has expired. Sign in and try again.`

Do not expose implementation wording such as table names, SQL constraints, RLS policies, bucket paths, environment-variable names, stack traces, provider configuration, or internal response bodies.

## Translation boundary

- Branch on stable structured fields such as Supabase Auth `code`, PostgREST/Postgres `code`, Storage `statusCode` and error name, or an application-owned error code.
- Do not branch on provider message text. Provider wording is unstable and may include sensitive implementation detail.
- Translate raw failures at the repository, service, or shared error boundary before they reach UI code.
- Use `UserFacingError` for application-approved product copy and preserve the original failure as its `cause` for diagnostics.
- UI catches must call `getUserFacingErrorMessage(error, actionSpecificFallback)` rather than rendering `error.message`.
- Unknown errors always use an action-specific fallback. They must never fall through to raw wording.

## Diagnostics and monitoring

User-friendly copy and technical diagnostics serve different audiences:

- show only translated product copy in the interface
- retain the original error or `cause` for Sentry and server logs
- log complete provider errors only to trusted diagnostics, never to UI, URLs, analytics properties, or public responses
- avoid including secrets, tokens, personal data, SQL payloads, or signed URLs in diagnostics

Supabase Edge Functions must return controlled public error bodies. Unexpected exceptions should be logged server-side and replaced with a stable generic response.

## Async state requirements

Every user-critical query must distinguish:

- loading
- successful data
- empty or genuinely not-found data
- request failure

A request failure must not be presented as an empty or not-found result. Provide a dedicated error state with a retry action when retrying is safe. Mutation errors must remain visible near the action or form until the user retries or changes the relevant input.

## Permission denial

Never stop silently after a denied device permission. Explain:

- which permission is needed
- which action requires it
- whether the user can retry the prompt
- when the user must enable access in device settings

Canceling a picker or system sheet is not an error and should remain quiet.

## Verification checklist

- tests cover stable-code mappings and confirm unknown technical messages use the supplied fallback
- query failure and not-found paths are reviewed separately
- denied permission paths display guidance on iOS, Android, and web where applicable
- `rg "error\\.message"` does not find UI rendering or UI state assignment of raw exception messages
- provider and Edge Function responses do not forward unexpected exception messages
